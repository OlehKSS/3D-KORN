\section{Issue Handling}
\begin{itemize}	
	\item With our current version of PCL (1.6.0) interface through OpenNI is not compatible with KinectV2 and the OpenNI2 interface is not fully implemented. Moreover, the Kinect SDK 2.0, which is the minimum required for interfacing with KinectV2, is compiled with MSVC2012 and is not compatible with our compilation of PCL (MSVC 2010). Two branches of development will try to solve the issue, one trying to install PCL 1.8.0 in Windows to use the Kinect SDK 2.0 and the other will try to interface the Intel R200.

	This has caused a delay in the specification of scanning process and, as a result, GUI and UML work couldn't progress as expected due to the relation with it. Albert and Eze have been reassigned to the Interfacing with sensor team to try and overcome this issue.
\end{itemize}

\section{Work in Progress}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Reviewed KinectFusion and DynamicFusion algorithms  as they seem no to be suited for the project due to their complexity and time requirements. We finally decided to use 3D registration algorithms from PCL library as it will work regardless of the final sensor used (KinectV2 or Intel R200) and development that depended on this particular algorithm is now free to continue.
	
	\item Reassignment of tasks for \emph{Interfacing} with sensors team based on priority:\\
		~\\Tasks:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Try to interface with both Intel R200 and KinectV2, to see which one is more compatible and simple to interface.
			\item  Generate PCL point cloud from scan.
		\end{itemize}
		Members: Pamir, Dani, Albert, Eze. 
		
\end{itemize}

\section{Tasks for this week}
\begin{itemize}
	\item KT session on coding standards for the whole team
	\item Complete POC and start work on UML design with a Use Case diagram and Class diagrams.
\end{itemize}

%\section{Tasks completed}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Infrastructure setup which enables us to work as a team
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Github for code repository and file sharing. \\Link for the repository -					https://github.com/umaatgithub/3D-KORN
%		\item Trello for creating storyboards and setting up meetings
%		\item Facebook group and messenger group for communication
%		\item QT for development platform	
%	\end{itemize}
